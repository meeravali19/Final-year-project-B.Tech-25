# 🎯 Final Year Project - B.Tech (2025)
Welcome to our Final Year Project repository!  
This project is aimed at solving binary and multi-class classification problems using various machine learning techniques, supported by a basic frontend interface for real-time user interaction.  
We developed a complete pipeline: from data preparation, model building, evaluation, to a simple frontend to demonstrate predictions.

## 🧠 About the Project

**Objective:**  
To build robust machine learning models capable of handling binary classification (e.g., yes/no, benign/malicious) and multi-class classification (e.g., different types of attacks or diseases).

**Scope:**

- Develop and train ML models.  
- Prepare custom datasets suited for classification tasks.  
- Create a simple and user-friendly frontend for model testing.  
- Analyze model performance and identify improvement areas.  
- This project acts as a mini-version of real-world machine learning pipelines.

- NumPy (mathematical operations)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

## ⚙️ Installation
Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/meeravali19/Final-year-project-B.Tech-25.git
   cd Final-year-project-B.Tech-25
   ```
2. **Install dependencies: Ensure Python and pip are installed. Then:**
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
## 🧩 Usage Guide
- **Binary Classification:**
  - Navigate to ```binary_classification/```
  - Open the relevant .ipynb file.
  - Follow the notebook cells: from loading data ➔ preprocessing ➔ model building ➔ evaluation.
- **Multi-Class Classification:**
   - Similar steps under ```multi_class_classification/. ```
- **Dataset Preparation:**
  - Explore ```dataset_formation/``` to see how raw data is cleaned and transformed.
