# 🎯 Final Year Project - B.Tech (2025)
Welcome to our Final Year Project repository!  
This project is aimed at solving binary and multi-class classification problems using various machine learning techniques, supported by a basic frontend interface for real-time user interaction.  
We developed a complete pipeline: from data preparation, model building, evaluation, to a simple frontend to demonstrate predictions.

## 🧠 About the Project

**Objective:**  
To build robust machine learning models capable of handling binary classification (e.g., yes/no, benign/malicious) and multi-class classification (e.g., different types of attacks or diseases).

**Scope:**

- Develop and train ML models.  
- Prepare custom datasets suited for classification tasks.  
- Create a simple and user-friendly frontend for model testing.  
- Analyze model performance and identify improvement areas.  
- This project acts as a mini-version of real-world machine learning pipelines.

Each folder focuses on a specific part of the ML workflow — organized for clarity and easy exploration.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook (for prototyping)  
- scikit-learn (machine learning models)  
- Pandas (data manipulation)  
- NumPy (mathematical operations)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

## ⚙️ Installation
Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/meeravali19/Final-year-project-B.Tech-25.git
   cd Final-year-project-B.Tech-25
   ```
2. **Install dependencies: Ensure Python and pip are installed. Then:**
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
## 🧩 Usage Guide
- **Binary Classification:**
  - Navigate to ```binary_classification/```
  - Open the relevant .ipynb file.
  - Follow the notebook cells: from loading data ➔ preprocessing ➔ model building ➔ evaluation.
- **Multi-Class Classification:**
   - Similar steps under ```multi_class_classification/. ```
- **Dataset Preparation:**
  - Explore ```dataset_formation/``` to see how raw data is cleaned and transformed.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Binary and Multi-Class Support:**
Handle both simple and complex classification problems.

- **Custom Dataset Formation:**
Automated scripts to clean, format, and split datasets.

- **Frontend Integration:**
A lightweight frontend that communicates with ML models.

- **Performance Analysis:**
Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

- **Visualization:**
Charts and graphs to understand model behavior better.

## 📊 Results and Evaluation
- Binary classification models achieved good accuracy (~90%+ in some cases).

- Multi-class classification faced natural challenges but still achieved promising results after tuning.

- Visualizations like confusion matrices and ROC curves were used to validate model performance.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Handling imbalanced datasets during classification.

- Preventing overfitting while training models.

- Limited frontend-backend communication (currently simulated manually).

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Integrate a proper backend (like Flask or FastAPI) to connect frontend with models.

- Deploy models using AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

- Expand dataset size for better generalization.

- Build an automated model retraining pipeline.
